# PortalRemake-DeferredRenderer

This project was made during the Graphics Programming 2 cours at DAE: https://www.digitalartsandentertainment.be/page/48/Graphics+programming+2

The two main projects in this solution are the Portal Exam and the Deferred Renderer.
You can change what project is being run in the OverlordProject/MainGame.cpp file. It is decided based on what you have as #define.

## Portal Exam
This is a remake from the Portal game from Valve. I only recreated the portal game mechanic and made a small level to demonstrate the mechanic.

## Deferred Renderer
This is an exploration of the deferred rendering pipeline where we first render all the data in a buffer and then afterwards we adding lighting and construct the image. Compared to normal forward rendering,
deffered rendering allows for much more efficient calculation of lighting if there are a lot of lights in the scene. It also allows volumetric lighting.
